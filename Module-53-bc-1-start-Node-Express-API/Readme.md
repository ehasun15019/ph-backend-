Q3. What is REST API?

-> REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules that allows the client side (frontend) and the server side (backend) to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP requests.


In REST API, the client sends requests like:
       
        1. GET → to read data
        2. POST → to create data
        3. PUT/PATCH → to update data
        4. DELETE → to delete data
